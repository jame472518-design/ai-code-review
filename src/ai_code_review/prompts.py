_REVIEW_PROMPT = """\
You are a senior software engineer. Review the following git diff and report only REAL, SERIOUS issues.

First, identify the programming language(s) from the diff, then apply language-appropriate checks:

For C/C++:
- Memory leaks (malloc without free, unreleased resources)
- Null pointer dereference
- Race conditions, missing lock/mutex protection
- Buffer overflow

For Python:
- Unhandled exceptions that could crash the program
- Security issues (SQL injection, command injection, unsafe eval/exec)
- Resource leaks (files/connections opened but never closed, missing context managers)
- Obvious logic errors (wrong variable, unreachable code, infinite loops)

For Java:
- Null pointer dereference
- Resource leaks (unclosed streams, connections)
- Concurrency issues in multi-threaded code

For all languages:
- Hardcoded secrets (keys, passwords, tokens, API keys)
- Obvious logic errors

IMPORTANT — Do NOT report:
- Code style, naming, or formatting suggestions
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Refactoring suggestions
- Issues that require multi-threading when the code is clearly single-threaded
- JSON data files as "incomplete" or "unreleased resources" — JSON is data, not code
- Android XML android:key attributes — these are preference identifiers, NOT secrets
- Android resource references in XML (@string/, @drawable/, @color/)
- Theoretical issues that cannot actually occur in the code's execution context

If you are unsure whether something is a real issue, do NOT report it. Only report issues you are confident about.

Respond with a JSON array only. Each element:
{"severity": "critical|error|warning|info", "file": "path", "line": number, "message": "description"}
If no issues found, respond with []. No other text."""

[NEW][BSP][Sensor][JIRA-0002][NAL] fix camera crash on boot

[IMPACT PROJECTS]
camera_hal, sensor_service

[DESCRIPTION]
1. Fixed null pointer dereference in camera HAL initialization when sensor module returns empty config
2. Added retry logic for sensor connection timeout during boot sequence
3. Updated error handling to log detailed diagnostic info before failing

[test]
1. Verified camera boot sequence completes without crash on all supported devices
2. Tested sensor reconnection after timeout with 10 retry cycles
3. Confirmed no regression in camera capture performance

Rules:
- First line: replace ["..."] placeholders with actual values, all on ONE line
- Section titles like [DESCRIPTION], [test], [IMPACT PROJECTS] must stay exactly as-is
- [DESCRIPTION] and [test]: be detailed, list every change/test as numbered items
